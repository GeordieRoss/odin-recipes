        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Vegan Hungarian Goulash is similar to traditional, but with a vegan twist. This is a meatless vegetarian
            goulash, but I promise you wonâ€™t miss it. It is hearty, savory and with a touch of red wine to give it a
            truly
            delicious deep flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 packed cups (320g) finely chopped white onion</li>
            <li>2 red bell peppers, chopped (270g)</li>
            <li>6 extra large cloves garlic, minced (18g)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 - 3 cups (690g) low-sodium broth (amounts added at different times)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3-5 tablespoons Unsmoked Hungarian Paprika (I used 5, but that may be too strong for some,
                so start with 3 and add more if desired. It's important to use Hungarian for the best flavor)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60g) dry red wine</li>
            <li>8 small (560g) red or gold potatoes (do not use russet), chopped into 1/2 inch chunks</li>
            <li>One 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with juices (mine had added salt)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (and a good pinch of cayenne if you want a kick)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="method">
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Have all of your vegetables chopped and ready to go before beginning, as the cooking process is fairly
                quick.</li>

            <li>Add the onion, bell peppers, garlic, JUST 1 cup of the broth and JUST 1/2 teaspoon of the salt to a
                large
                pot over medium heat. Once it begins to bubble all over, cook for about 8 minutes until the veggies are
                tender and all the broth is gone. You want the broth gone before adding the wine, this will keep the
                sauce
                thick and not watery at the end.</li>

            <li>Add the paprika and wine and cook for about 3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add the potatoes, tomatoes, pepper, another 1/2 teaspoon salt and the remaining broth. Start out with 1
                1/2
                cups and add more if desired or needed to cook the potatoes. I used the full 2 cups because my potatoes
                needed it and I wanted it a bit saucy. Stir well and turn the heat to high. Once it comes to a boil,
                cover
                and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are tender, but not
                mushy.
                Taste and add any more seasoning if needed. Serve immediately either as is or over white rice.</li>
        </ol>
