    <h1>Fluffy Vegan Oatmeal Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../assets/pancakes.jpg" alt="sample" height="300" width="400">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using aquafaba for vegan oatmeal pancakes is especially successful because oatmeal pancakes tend to be a little
        denser than, say, buttermilk pancakes to begin with, and aquafaba doesn't have quite the lifting power and
        structure that eggs do. For these pancakes, I start by toasting oats in a skillet until they're nutty and
        fragrant, then I grind them up in a food processor and combine them with some standard dry pancake ingredients:
        all-purpose flour, baking powder and soda, and salt. Next, I whip up the aquafaba into a dense, stable meringue
        sweetened with just a touch of sugar. Nut milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and a little vinegar
        (to help with rise) make up the liquid ingredients. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ounces rolled oats (about 3/4 cup; 140g)</li>

        <li>5 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup; 140g)</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons (8g) baking powder</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon (4g) kosher salt</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons (60ml) liquid from 1 can of low-sodium chickpeas (reserve remaining liquid and chickpeas for
            another use)</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons (60g) sugar</li>

        <li>1 1/2 cups almond, rice, or soy milk (about 12 ounces; 355ml)</li>

        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable oil, plus more for cooking</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) vanilla extract</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons zest from 1 lemon</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar</li>

        <li>Vegan butter substitute and maple syrup, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oats in a medium skillet over medium heat, tossing and stirring frequently, until toasted and nutty,
            about 4 minutes.</li>

        <li>Transfer to the bowl of a food processor, let cool a few moments, and pulse until about half the oats are
            powdered but a few larger flakes remain, 10 to 12 short pulses. </li>

        <li>Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and pulse to combine.</li>

        <li>Place chickpea liquid and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.</li>

        <li>Whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, combine almond milk, vegetable oil,
            vanilla extract, lemon zest, and vinegar in a bowl.</li>

        <li>Add dry mix to wet mix and fold with a rubber spatula to combine (the mixture should remain lumpy). Fold in
            whipped chickpea liquid, being careful not to let it deflate too much.</li>

        <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle).
        </li>

        <li>Add a small amount of vegan butter or oil to skillet or griddle and spread with a paper towel until no
            visible butter or oil remains. Reduce heat to low. Use a 1/4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in skillet
            and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. </li>

        <li>Carefully flip pancakes and cook on second side until golden brown and completely set, about 3 minutes
            longer. Serve pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven
            while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and vegan butter. </li>
    </ol>
