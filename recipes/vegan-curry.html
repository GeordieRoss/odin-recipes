            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is a unqiue hot and sour vegan curry. Small 5-8cm long purple or white aubergines work well here if
                you can find them; simply cut them in half lengthways from the bottom, stopping at the stalk, so you can
                have a split aubergine that's held together by the talks - a unqiue and attractive touch if you're
                looking to impress at a dinner party.

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven 200c/180c fan. In a large bowl, toss the aubergine with 2tbsp of the cocnut oil,
                    1/2 tsp of the ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt. Spread out in a large roasting tray in
                    a single layer and roast for 15 minutes, tossing every 5 minutes or so.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp coconut oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat and add the
                    mustard and fenugreek seeds. Once the mustard seeds stop crackling, add the pandan leaf, cinamon
                    stick, curry leaves, onion, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and dried chillies. Stir well to coat in the
                    oil, add a pinch of salt and continue to cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the
                    onions are soft and translucent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the curry powder and remaining 1/2 tsp ground turmeric and cook for a further minute, adding a
                    splash of water if they begin to stick to the pan. Add the coconut milk, stock or water and
                    tamarind, reduce the heat to low and cook 3-4 minutes until the liquid has reduced to half. Stir
                    through the roasted aubergine and sugar and continue to simmer for 3 minutes then season to taste
                    with salt. Serve with steamed rice or rolls.
